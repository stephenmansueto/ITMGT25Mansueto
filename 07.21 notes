WORKING WITH DATA

Tools
    data types
    conditionals
    loops
    functions

today we look at how tools are normally used to analyze / manipulate data
python is powerful but most people are ME (so we gotta work with lots of data in 3rd and 4th year)

DATA MAPPING
    most of the time, there's no direct tool you can use to map 
    you just do this to a set of data (anything that's not atomic is a set and can therefore be mapped)
    DEFINITION
        given a collection, produce a second collection where each element is a TRANSFORMATION of the elements in the first
    example:
        L = [1,2,3,4,5]
        if we want to turn this into a list of squares
        L2 = [1,4,9,16,25]
        you can:
            create an empty list
            use a for loop to square the numbers
            append them to the list!
            elements here included the orginal collection, an iteration of the collection, then transformation, then adding to a second collection
        BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE THE MAP FUNCTION:

LIST COMPREHENSION
    L = [1,2,3,4,5]
    [x ** 2 for x in l]

FILTERING
    you usually define a function outside and then just use them in the filter 


There are built-in functions for map and filter 
    you can use this, just define your function and collection, then use the functions na
    you can pass functions to other functions

REDUCTION / REDUCE
    reducing a collection to an atomic value
    will only produce one atomic value, also called aggregation
    example: getting the sum from a list 
        e.g. my_sum = 0
        for num in l:
            my_sum +=num 
        ^^THAT ABOVE IS ALREADY A FORM OF REDUCTION 
    python doesn't have a function for reduce
        e.g. def reduce (acc, next)
        return acc+next
